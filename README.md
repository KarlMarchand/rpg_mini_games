Repo to regroup a few mini-games I'm making for my players in our Star Wars rpg campaigns

## Hacking Mini-Game
The goal is to provide the players a more immersive experience when they have to hack into a computer. The mini-game is based on the mastermind boardgame and the player has to make guesses until they find the right combination. For more details, see the Hacking Mini-Game's readme.
